You're part of a DevOps team preparing deployment scripts for staging environments. Each script must be:

Owned and writable only by you
written ,Executable by your team (group)
Inaccessible to others on the system
Additionally, you must demonstrate what happens when permissions are configured incorrectly — and how to fix them.

🛠 Task
Create a new directory to store deployment scripts.
Write a script named deploy.sh that simulates a deployment process.
Configure permissions to meet the scenario's security requirements.
Deliberately apply insecure permissions (e.g., full access to others), then correct them.
Capture ls -l outputs at each significant state change.
⚠️ Do not reuse test_script.sh. Start fresh and apply your knowledge independently.

What to Submit
deploy.sh in your repo
ls -l output screenshots showing:
Initial script permissions
After secure configuration
After insecure permissions applied (e.g., 777)
After secure permissions restored
Completed reflection responses from Part 5 (in the same file or new one)
GitHub push with all updates
Notes

Do not repeat answers from the previous task.
Use this task to prove you understand:
Ownership vs. group vs. others
Numeric vs. symbolic modes
Practical risks of over-permissive settings
Think like an engineer preparing for a production deployment.
